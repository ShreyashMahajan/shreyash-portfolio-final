        <h2>WHY SKILLS ARE NECESSARY FOR GETTING SUCCESS</h2>
        <small>September, 2021</small>
        <p>Many people confuse about skill and degrees. They think that skill means the degree they have done. But it's not like that.
        </p>
        <P>Many people do degrees, just for the sake of doing a degree. But the main purpose of a degree is to understand and gain skills through it. So that it can make you job-ready or business ready, depending on your requirements. </P>
        <p>Only getting a degree but no skills will not be going to work. For example, if you are applying for the role of a fresher software engineer in the company. You have a degree and know all the theory parts properly but you don't know how to apply it practically. Then it means that you were not able to gain skills through your degree. Because until and unless you don't know how to use it then how will the employer get from you. And if he is not getting benefits from you then why will he hire you. It's very simple that people will only hire you if you provide some value.</p>
        <h3>But there are not enough jobs?.</h3>
        <p>really are there not enough jobs in the market. It's not like that there are so many jobs in the market but people are unemployed because they don't have the skill which are required to get a particular job. In India every year approximately 10 lakh graduates complete their engineering degree, but only 16-20% of the students are employable, which means that 80% of the people are not eligible for getting the jobs because they don't have skills which is required by the employer. </p>
        <p>If students are not getting skills, then obviously it's their fault, but along with that, the institute in which they are studying is also liable for the fault, because at least they should have helped them gain the skills. Many of the students want to learn but they don't have proper guidance and opportunities. </p>
        <h3>Many institutions are just businesses </h3>
        <p>Majority of the college running in India is the business factories which is just making people take admission and generating lots of money for the directors and institutions trust. There is some institution that is really providing values but we cannot ignore the fact that majority of the institutes are not eligible for giving a degree.</p>
        <h3>If there are some institutions which is providing value then why don't student take admission there?</h3>
        <p>because there are very limited seats available and the others who were not able to get the seats doesn't mean that they will not be able to do anything in life. </p>
        <h3>What is the solution to this ?.</h3>
        <p>So this is the internet age and many startups have recognised this problem that students are facing. and in the coming years, those and the upcoming startup similar to those will be disrupting this fake traditional institute methodology and this startup will value and people will trust them more.</p>
        <p>There are some startup-like neogcamp, digitaldeepak , apnaschool, and many youtube channels that are providing a very huge amount of value. </p>
        <p>There are a lot more things that will be shared in the upcoming blogs and that will help people to succeed in life.</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for reading this blog.</p>
