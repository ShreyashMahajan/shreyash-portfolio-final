        <h1>What is Blockchain technology ?.</h1>
        <p>Isn’t it very hard or we can say complicated to know that what actually blockchain technology means. Let’s understand it in the simplest way possible.
        </p>
        <p>So blockchain technology is the bookkeeping of the data such as purchase, sell, transaction of money etc. at the decentralized level. 
        </p>
        <h3>What is decentralized Level -</h3>
        <p>So there are some ways by which data can be stored and bookkeeping of data can be done. One is centralized level and another is decentralized level.</p>
        <h3>Centralized level -</h3>
        <p>At this level, all the transactions or the bookkeeping is stored at one server only which is the main server. For example, there are five people who give money to each other and to keep a track record of transactions, they appoint a sixth person whose work is to keep bookkeeping of this data.</p>
        <p>Now here one day what happens is that the sixth person who is keeping track of data tears one page from his book to eat bhelpuri. Now the transaction written on that page is lost and the person who given money to the other person asks for his money back, but the other person denies that he had not taken any money from him. Because the transaction is lost.
            So here a problem is generated as the transaction was only written in one book, so they can’t check at any other place.
            </p>
            <p>So centralized data means all the data which is there is saved at the server level, for example, all the data of WhatsApp messenger is stored in the server of WhatsApp or Facebook (as it is the parent company of WhatsApp) and if in any case the data is lost, then the data of each and every person’s WhatsApp will be lost.
            </p>
            <h3>Decentralized Level -
            </h3>
            <p>Decentralized level means all the bookkeeping of the transaction which is being carried out is stored with each and every one. Like each and everyone have a book and pen, where every time a transaction is done then the record is being written. So if in any case, if one person lost the data then he can see the data from another person. Decentralized means data is saved on each and every person record
            </p>
            <p>Blockchain technology is mainly used for the purpose of security of our data. Because if someone hacks our important data such as bank account detail, property details and changes it, then we will not be able to prove that, the property actually belonged to us.
            </p>
            <p>All the cryptocurrency works on bitcoin technology, bank transaction, property registration.
                But how blockchain provides security, look all the data is at a decentralized level so if any transaction takes place then a block of code is added to each user, so if some want to hack and change the data then he has to change the data in each and every person account as each and every account is connected with each other, let’s say there are n number of people. It starts from a,b,c,d,.....n. If one person wants to make a change in the data of a, then he has to change data in b, as b is linked with a, if he has to make changes in b then he has to make changes in c as c is also linked with b, so like this, the chain continues and it is impossible to make changes in each persons data. Which make it more secure for transactions.
                </p>
                <p>So this was all about blockchain Technology.</P> 
                    <P></P> Thank you so much for reading this </p>
